Hello there! ‚úãüèª

This is a calculator to optimize product sales by minimizing production cost. To start running this app, be sure you have python and PIP installed. Also, you have to install these 4 python libraries:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scipy

If you don't know whether they are installed or not, run these codes in your terminal (for mac):

For PIP: `python -m pip --version`

For numpy: `python -m pip show numpy`

For pandas: `python -m pip show pandas`

For scipy: `python -m pip show scipy`

For flask: `python -m pip show flask`

To install these libraries type:

For numpy: `python -m pip install numpy`

For pandas: `python -m pip install pandas`

For scipy: `python -m pip install scipy`

For flask: `python -m pip install flask`
